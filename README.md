Collaborators should give a brief description of their Name, background and other relevant particulars such as projects they are currently working on


My name is Margaret Wanjiku. I did Biochemistry for my undergrad degree. I am currently at Pwani doing a masters in Bioinformatics. I am fascinated by genes and the human body as a whole. I love Bioinformatics and I feel priveleged to be in this course. Though excruciatingly exhausting, I love the journey thus far. I look forward starting my project.
